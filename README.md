# Voldemort-Discord-Bot

Created a user-interactive discord bot using node.js. This bot has multiple commands which get executed if client input's certain message. One command retrieves a random .png from a subreddit while another command allows the user to play rock, paper, scizzors against the computer. All the commands are listed in the /commands folder.
